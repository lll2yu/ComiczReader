# ComiczReader
A webview app to read comics from readcomics.website with adblocking feature.

**Q: Why does this app exist?**

  A: It takes atleast two taps to open chrome bookmarks and as lazy as I am that's too much work for me so I created this app to directly open my favourite website. You can enjoy the ease as well.
